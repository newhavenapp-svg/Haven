# Haven
Haven is your friendly digital guardian, designed to keep you informed with real-time safety updates while keeping your device secure.

We built Haven because everyone deserves a "digital sanctuary"—a place where you can get the latest news and safety alerts without worrying about your device’s security. It’s about peace of mind, awareness, and staying one step ahead.
